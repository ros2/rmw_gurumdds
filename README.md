# rmw_gurumdds
Implementation of the ROS middleware interface using [GurumNetworks GurumDDS](https://www.gurum.cc/index_eng).
[Installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/DDS-Implementations/Working-with-GurumNetworks-GurumDDS.html) is available.

## Requirements
Required version of GurumDDS depends on the version of this project.

| rmw_gurumdds             | GurumDDS                    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 3.4.2  or higher         | higher than 3.0.0           |
| 3.3.0  or higher         | higher than 2.8.3165        |
| 3.2.0  or higher         | 2.8.3140 or higher          |
| 3.1.2  or higher         | 2.8.x                       |
| 3.1.1  or lower          | 2.7.x                       |

## Packages
This project consists of three packages, `gurumdds_camke_module`, `rmw_gurumdds_cpp` and `demo_nodes_cpp_native_gurumdds`.

### gurumdds_cmake_module
`gurumdds_cmake_module` looks for GurumDDS, and provides the information to other packages.
For `gurumdds_cmake_module` to work properly, you need to set `GURUMDDS_HOME` environment variable to where GurumDDS is located.
If GurumDDS is normally installed through the debian package, `GURUMDDS_HOME` will be set automatically.
For example, if `GURUMDDS_HOME=~/gurumdds` is set, the directory `~/gurumdds` will be:
```
gurumdds
├── include
│   └── gurumdds
│       ├── dcps.h
│       ├── dcpsx.h
│       ├── dds.h
│       ├── typesupport.h
│       └── xml.h
└── lib
    └── libgurumdds.so
```

### rmw_gurumdds_cpp
`rmw_gurumdds_cpp` is the rmw implementation. You can use this rmw implementation by setting environment variable `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_gurumdds_cpp` after installation.
For `rmw_gurumdds_cpp` to work properly, make sure to set environment variable `GURUMDDS_CONFIG=~/gurumdds.yaml` and set `allow_loopback` variable in `gurumdds.yaml` to `true`.
`gurumdds.yaml` will be located in `/etc/gurumnet/gurumdds` if gurumdds is installed through the debian package.
If you are not familiar with [YAML](https://yaml.org/), please note that YAML only supports spaces, not tabs, for indentation.

```
DATA:
  allow_loopback: true
  dynamic_buffer: true
  mtu: auto # auto | number(1472)
  bitmap_capacity: 256
  buffer_capacity: 512
```

### rmw_gurumdds_shared_cpp
~~`rmw_gurumdds_shared_cpp` contains some functions used by `rmw_gurumdds_cpp`.~~
This package was integrated into `rmw_gurumdds_cpp`.

### demo_nodes_cpp_native_gurumdds
`demo_nodes_cpp_natvie_gurumdds` is similar to `demo_nodes_cpp_native` from ROS2 `demos`.
This demo shows how to access the native handles of `rmw_gurumdds_cpp`.
This package is disabled by default.

## Branches
There are three active branches in this project: master, iron, humble.
New changes made in [ROS2 repository](https://github.com/ros2) will be applied to the master branch.
If you want to use this project with ROS2 Rolling Ridley or Iron Irwini, please use master or iron branch, respectively.

## Implementation Status
Currently some features are not fully implemented.
- DDS Security
